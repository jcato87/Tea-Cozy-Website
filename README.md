# Tea-Shop-Website

Website: https://jcato87.github.io/Tea-Shop-Website/

This project opens to a tea shop's website.

Purpose: This site was created as a project in my full stack developer bootcamp. I was given the pictures for the site, and--using all that I've learned about HTML and CSS stylings--had to build a website with the pictures.  

Built with: HTML and CSS.
